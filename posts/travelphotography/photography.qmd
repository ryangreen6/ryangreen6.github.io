When I was younger, I saw a presentation by the National Geographic wildlife photographer Mattias Klum, and it inspired me to develop my photography. All I wanted when I 'grew up' was to be a photographer for National Geographic. 

Although I grew in other directions, photography has always been a passion of mine, and during my travels I've been able to capture some shots I'm proud of.

Below are just a few of my favorites:
