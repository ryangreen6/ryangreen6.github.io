    "text": "Ryan Green is pursuing a master’s degree in Environmental Data Science to align his career with his passion for geography and spatial data. Ryan has a BA in Geography and Archaeology from Sonoma State University after finding love for these subjects at an early age.\nDuring his senior year at Sonoma State, Ryan studied abroad at the University of Ghana, Legon, where he focused on anthropology and archaeological field methods. He participated in the fourth field season of the Gonja Project, a collaborative excavation between the University of Ghana and the University of Geneva, Switzerland. He produced stratigraphy and feature maps of the site and contributed to the annual field publication. After returning to Sonoma State, Ryan took on a geoarchaeological study for his undergraduate dissertation, analyzing soil samples from across a Native American site in northern California to determine occupational patterns over time.\nHe moved back to Santa Barbara after college and volunteered at the Natural History Museum’s Anthropology Department, where he assisted in collections management and accessioning artifacts. Ryan has always been passionate about cultural resource management and mapping, and plans to put his master’s degree to work in these fields using LiDAR and other geospatial techniques."

    "text": "The purpose of this notebook is to show how to work with shapefiles and raster data, particularly xarray.Datasets. In this notebook, we will do simple exploration of the xarray.Dataet called landsat, which is an image of the Santa Barbara County area, and contains data for visible, infrared, and near infrared color bands. We will see how to generate false color images from this raster, where color bands can be rearranged to emphasize certain features on the image (for example, make the fire scar of the Thomas Fire much more visible). The dataset landsat comes from the Landsat satellite, and the data was sourced here: https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2"
