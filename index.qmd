Ryan Green is currently pursing a master’s degree in Environmental Data Science through the Bren School at UCSB. Ryan graduated from Sonoma State University in 2019 with a BA in Geography and Archaeology. 

During his senior year at Sonoma State, Ryan studied abroad at the University of Ghana, Legon, where he focused on anthropology and archaeological field methods. He participated in the fourth field season of the Gonja Project, a collaborative excavation between the University of Ghana and the University of Geneva, Switzerland. He produced stratigraphy and feature maps of the site and contributed to the annual field publication. After returning to Sonoma State, Ryan took on a geoarchaeological study for his undergraduate dissertation, analyzing soil samples from across a Native American site in northern California to determine occupational patterns over time. He moved back to Santa Barbara after college and volunteered at the Natural History Museum's Anthropology Department, where he assisted in collections management and accessioning artifacts. 

After several years in the hospitality industry as a front desk agent and hotel supervisor, Ryan worked for the international humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief. In his two years there, he managed partnerships with large hospitals and small clinics in Haiti, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Malawi, and Nepal, among others. Ryan is responsible for the arrangement and delivery of more than 60 large scale donations of medical supplies and prescription medications, from small packages to 40-foot shipping containers. Although rewarding, Ryan decided to redirect his career towards his interests in data projects. 

Ryan has always been passionate about cultural resource management and mapping, and has particular interests in LiDAR, remote sensing, and other geospatial techniques. His master’s degree program has helped him develop his skills in data wrangling and analysis.
